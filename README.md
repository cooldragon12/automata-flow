# AutomataFlow
AutomataFlow is a web application that simulates a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) based on a given regular expression problem. It also includes support for Pushdown Automata (PDA) and Context-Free Grammars (CFG). The DFA diagram in the application is interactive, allowing you to validate or simulate input strings.

## Features
- Simulates Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), Pushdown Automata (PDA), and Context-Free Grammars (CFG)
- Interactive DFA diagram for visualization
- Validation and simulation of input strings
- Built with Next.js 13.4 App Router for efficient routing
- Animation support using Framer Motion
- Styling with Tailwind CSS
## Installation
To run AutomataFlow locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automataflow.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd automataflow
```
3. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```
4. Start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

## Usage
- On the main page of AutomataFlow, you will see the DFA diagram representing the given regular expression problem.
- To validate or simulate an input string, enter the string in the input box provided.
- Click the "Validate" button to check if the input string is accepted by the DFA.
- To simulate the input string, click the "Simulate" button. The DFA's state transitions will be animated to demonstrate the string's processing.
- You can navigate to the PDA and CFG sections of the application to explore and simulate those automata as well.
### NOTE: Please note that currently, AutomataFlow only supports the given regular expression problem. Inputting your own regular expression to convert it into a DFA is not yet implemented.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js 13.4 App Router: A powerful framework for building server-rendered React applications with efficient routing capabilities.
- Framer Motion: A library for creating smooth animations in React applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
